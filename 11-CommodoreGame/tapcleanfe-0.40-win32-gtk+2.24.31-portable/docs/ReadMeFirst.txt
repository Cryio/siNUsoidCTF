TAPClean Front End
------------------
TAPClean Front End is a graphical environment for analyzing the contents of tape images 
in TAP and DC2N DMP format.
It relies on the engine provided by TAPClean, a console application derived from Final 
TAP (console version) whose source code is distributed under the terms of the GPL license. 
Please note that TAPClean FE is not distributed under the terms of the GPL license, yet 
it is freeware.

Final TAP is (C) 2001-2006, Stewart Wilson, Subchrist Software.

This software is based on GTK+ libraries release 2.24.31 or later. A GTK+ runtime package 
is therefore required.
